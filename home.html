          <p>Dear Isaac,</p>
        <p>
            Although I wish I could've bought you a gift, I still wanted to give maa man something special,
          so I made you this card because I love you dearly, and you still deserve something from me, 
          even if I can't spend money.I want to wish you the happiest birthday, my sweetheart („• ᴗ •„) 
          I really wish I could be there with you all day, holding you, hugging you, making you smile,
          and kissing you. You are genuninely my world, and I want you to know how much you mean to me
          today and everyday. Even though you don't have big plans for your birthday, I hope your day is
          as amazing as maaa honey boo boo bear is. I love you forever and alwways, 
          
                                            Happy 18th Birthday! ^-^ ♡
